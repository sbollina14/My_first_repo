Really, I am getting a little idea how a person behaves when he is at 30's take care of 
family and children so many things.

Buy a house is it possible?? Yeah everything is possible in man's life and to add living in USA 
you have to decide no body cares for you everybody gives emotional support to little extent.

You have to decide on your yourself what to do.
